                Everyday I wake up in search of courage and authentic expression. And on this journey, I've been met with opportunities to create impact in ways I'd never imagine. Janaury 2018 I became the inaugural Creative Director at Blavity, a global media platform
                that empowers Black creators with tools to change the world.

            <h1>10 / Love & MarRIAGE</h1>
            <p>
                On May 4, 2017, I married my partner of 7 years in Nassau, Bahamas. I'm forever grateful for the outpour of love and admiration we received for this moment. To know that our family and friends felt appreciated, deeply connected, and free to be themselves
                at our celebration meant to the world to me.

            <h1>09 / Walker & Family</h1>
            <p>
                I stumbled across an opportunity to build something my family and friends would be proud ofâ€”and I ultimately took a leap of faith to join Silicon Valley startup. Walker & Company gave me a first-hand experience in building a venture-backed business from
                ground up, and got me re-acquainted with my technical roots.

            <p>
                NYC, my home from 2014-2016, gave me space to grow as a designer, and helped me see myself more as an artist. With every lens snapped and every pixel laid, I became more of who I was meant to be.

            <p>
                My first day-job in Advertising bridged my intuition for design and my technical education as a product engineer. From Boston to New York, I helped Fortune 500 brands find their voice in a noisy, digital world as I continued to develop my own.
